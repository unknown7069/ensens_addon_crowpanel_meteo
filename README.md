## Prepare system

 1.Install VSCode.
 
 2.Install ESP-IDF Extension - Develop and debug applications for Espressif chips with ESP-IDF.
 
 3.Install ESP-IDF v5.4.1 (via ESP-IDF Extension).
 
 4.Open ENSENS_METEO project:
 
 - from "root" directory - write "code ." from CLI;
 - from "VSCode" - select "Open Folder..." from Menu.
   
 5.Configure VSCode "settings.json" (if you need).

## Build and Flash ENSENS_METEO project
 1.Сonnect your panel with a type-C cable to the PC port.
 
 2.Into VSCode:
 
 - select current ESP-IDF v5.4.1 version;
 - select ESP-IDF Flash Method - UART;
 - select Port to Use - your active COM port;
 - select Espressif Device Target- esp32s3.
   
 3.Into VSCode:
 - click "Build, Flash and Monitor".

### Quick build check from CLI

To verify that the project still builds without opening VSCode, run:

```powershell
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/test_build.ps1
```

Add `-Clean` if you need to start from a pristine `idf.py fullclean` before building.
